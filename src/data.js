Many of these properties then experienced very adverse seasonal conditions, with the 'wet' season failing to occur in late 2012/early 2013 across much of northern Australia. As pasture availability declined in some areas, especially north western Queensland, farmers were forced to either shoot cattle, or where economically feasible, ship them south to abattoirs.
