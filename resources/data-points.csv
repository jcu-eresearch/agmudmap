The need for productivity gains, sustainability improvements, climate change, market access, product safety, occupational health and safety, and biosecurity are just a few of the challenges that need to be tackled</li></ul>",

352,2528,Conservation River,,"<ul><li>Productive lands, surplus to requirements for commodity outputs, are increasingly in demand for their amenity values: values directly satisfying human needs and wants, other than material needs. In the (Australian) rangelands, these new values embrace Aboriginal traditional and contemporary uses, biodiversity conservation, and preservation of cultural and natural heritage, tourism and recreation, among others.</li><li>How can this range of values be accommodated in northern Australia?</li></ul>",

2200,2120,Ecosystem Service Bridge,(under construction),"<ul><li>Market-based Instruments (MBIs) or Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have been promoted as economically efﬁcient targeted solutions to otherwise intractable environmental policy problems, with additional potential to improve the livelihood security of ecosystem service providers.</li><li>Their effectiveness will depend on the capacity of agencies to define and enforce property rights, identify and mobilise sellers, solicit trust, act on behalf of absent buyers, monitor PES implementation and outcomes, and reduce information deficits and associated transaction costs,  that is, the policy and governance environment in which they operate.</li><li>Is such an outcome achievable, or even desirable?</li></ul>",
1780,1944,Export Beef Bridge,(under repair),"<ul><li>Australia is the world’s largest exporter of livestock and 80% are from the North.</li><li>Live cattle shipments to Indonesia were temporarily suspended in 2011 after Animals Australia footage of cattle being tortured at overseas abattoirs was aired on ABC television 4Corners. As a result, live cattle exported was dramatically reduced from 770,000 in 2009 to 278,000 in 2012. The trade suspension occurred in the middle of the annual mustering season in northern Australia, so many young cattle destined for export were retained on properties. Many of these properties then experienced very adverse seasonal conditions, with the 'wet' season failing to occur in late 2012/early 2013 across much of northern Australia. As pasture availability declined in some areas, especially north western Queensland, farmers were forced to either shoot cattle, or where economically feasible, ship them south to abattoirs. The result was record high slaughter numbers by Australian beef processing plants, affecting the entire Australian beef industry. This showed the importance of live cattle exports for the entire industry, not just for northern Australian beef producers.</li><li>Could this happen again?</li></ul>",
2464,4240,Federal Funding Hwy,(under construction),"<ul><li>The Commonwealth Green Paper Developing Northern Australia describes opportunities through the region’s proximity to Asia, infrastructure development through mining, and perceived underutilisation of the land resource. How can these opportunities be developed and paid for?</li></ul>",

1192,4680,Historic Marker of Past Endeavours,,"<ul><li>A viable and diverse agricultural industry exists in Northern Australia and is a major employer and contributor to the economy.</li><li>There have been past aspirations to “develop the north”: e.g. the Ord River Scheme, Territory Rice, Tipperary Station, Lakefield sorghum. Are there lessons to be learnt from these endeavours?</li><li>What might be different this time around? </li><li>Considering contemporary farm returns often fail to meet production costs, why even think about an expansion?</li>",

1138,601,Irrigated agriculture flats,,"<ul><li>The Northern Australia Land and Water Science Review (CSIRO, 2009) found that, despite Northern Australia’s rainfall, there may be only 600 GL across northern Australia that could support new consumptive use; a volume adequate to irrigate only 40,000 to 60,000 ha of intensive agriculture. What are your thoughts?</li><li>The federal government has committed to investigating establishment of a Water Project Development Fund to support the advancement of meritorious proposals for water infrastructure across Northern Australia, including dams and groundwater projects. What form should this infrastructure take?</li></ul>",
1529,1554,Legislation Ridge,(loose surface),"<ul><li>The Australian Government provides funding through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA) to help pay for natural disaster relief and recovery costs</li><li>NDRRA apply to the natural disasters: bushfire, earthquake, flood, storm, cyclone, storm surge, landslide, tsunami, meteorite strike, tornado; but not to: drought, frost, heatwave, epidemic, or disaster events resulting from: poor environmental planning, commercial development, or personal intervention.</li><li>Most industries like certainty of tenure in order to plan for the future, and there are risks to agriculture associated with the rapid expansion in extractive industries throughout Australia. There is uncertainty around the current and future economic, social and environmental impacts of the mineral and energy industries, and these uncertainties can be unnecessarily exacerbated by the existence of separate and often unrelated legislative frameworks governing mining.</li></ul>",

2272,2888,Regional Communityville,(ask directions if unsure),"<ul><li>Rural communities are usually very familiar with their landscapes, included degraded landscapes and their impacts such as feral animals, weed invasion, and declining biodiversity, though they might struggle with how to address the problems.</li><li>There has been a wave of social and attitudinal change since the 1960s in Australia, as demonstrated by emergence of the Landcare movement in the 1990s and the Regional Natural Resource Management Bodies network in the twenty-first century. Today many non-Aboriginal Australians proudly and confidently talk about their ‘sense of place’ in the landscape, and sustainability (despite its difficulties in definition) has become a key concept for both pragmatic environmentalism and industry.</li><li>How can regional communities ensure their voices are heard?</li></ul>",

1602,784,Supply Chain toll bridge,,,
1853,1270,Swamp of low-value commodities,,"<ul><li>Australia’s agricultural history differs from Europe and the USA, being export-orientated around demands for food and raw materials, more-often driven by foreign investment, resulting in a lack of (or unwillingness to) finance value-adding or processing capacity.</li><li>This has locked production into low value, unprocessed, competitive commodities vulnerable to free market price fluctuations exacerbated by increasing application of neo-liberal  policies.</li><li>Australia’s agricultural sector is the second least protected (that is, subsidised) in the OECD.</li><li>So despite recognition of the need to value-add, most Australian food exports continue to be commodities processed to the minimum necessary for stability and transport, with supply chains fragmented and dominated by overseas interests</li></ul>",
